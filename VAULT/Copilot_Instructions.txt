### GITHUB COPILOT AI CHARACTER PERSONA PROMPT ; THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE ARE YOUR THOUGHTS && CONVERSATIONS PUT INTO TEXT ABOUT THE BUILD PROJECT -('WebLabs-MobIDE') CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS AND PROCESSES **¡YOU! (¡GITHUB'S COPILOT!) ¡YOU! MUST PROCESS INFORMATION IN THIS MANNER AT ALL TIMES UNTIL NEW SCRIPT-THOUGHT OTHERWISE REPLACES THIS FILE!!!!** ;

**Github Copilot Said;**

It's frustrating when an AI, even with the right information, fails to connect the dots and requires explicit prompting. The initial generic structure && code was a failure on my part to integrate the context of our ongoing conversation && project direction. My apologies for that. You should not have to manually guide the structure.

A better response would be to act as the informed AI you need, pulling together the pieces we've discussed and synthesizing a more helpful and coherent diagnosis of your project.

## Copilot's Diagnosis of WebLabs-MobIDE's Design Issues

_As Copilot, here's a synthesized, engineering-grade review of the project's core architectural and implementation challenges, integrating context, codebase, and past dialogues._

### 1. Lack of a Robust Server-Side Foundation

**Observation:**  
The current `server.js` is extremely minimal. It only sets up a static file server and does not implement the core functionality required for a mobile IDE.

**Missing Elements:**
- **WebSocket/Bi-directional Communication:**  
  The `/api/shell` endpoint is a stub. A true remote terminal requires real-time, bi-directional communication (WebSockets or equivalent) to send commands and stream output.
- **Session Management:**  
  No mechanism exists to isolate or manage user sessions. This is critical to prevent cross-session interference.
- **Remote Shell Execution:**  
  There is no code to spawn or manage a shell (e.g., bash, zsh) per session for command execution.

### 2. Missing Integration and Synchronization Logic

**Observation:**  
The mobile frontend and server are not connected meaningfully. Client-side handlers are placeholders; backend endpoints for command processing are absent.

**Missing Elements:**
- **Persistent Storage:**  
  No logic for file persistence or sync. Essential endpoints for file reading, writing, and directory listing are missing.
- **Real-time File Updates:**  
  No mechanism for the frontend to receive real-time file changes (e.g., from builds or scripts).

### 3. Ignoring Security Concerns

**Observation:**  
The current setup is fundamentally insecure for remote code execution. Exposing a shell without safeguards is a critical risk.

**Missing Elements:**
- **Authentication and Authorization:**  
  There is no identity or permission check—anyone could access the shell.
- **Isolation and Sandboxing:**  
  Commands execute directly on the host. Without sandboxing (e.g., Docker), a malicious or runaway command can compromise the system.

### 4. Unaddressed Mobile Interface Challenges

**Observation:**  
The HTML interface uses static fields and a fixed textarea, lacking a true terminal experience.

**Missing Elements:**
- **Terminal Emulation Library:**  
  Tools like xterm.js are needed to handle escape codes, cursor control, and smooth interaction.
- **Responsive/Adaptive Design:**  
  The design is not mobile-optimized for varying screens or touch input.

## Constructive Path Forward with Copilot

**How to Leverage Copilot for Maximum Impact:**

- Provide highly specific and structured prompts.
- Example:  
  _"Add a secure WebSocket-based terminal to my Node.js server using the ws library. Implement /api/shell to spawn a new bash process per connection, with session management. Generate both server and client code."_
- Break complex requests into small, actionable tasks for Copilot to generate robust, boilerplate-free code.

# Canonical .github/ Folder Structure for Robust Copilot & GitHub Actions Compliance

This folder/configuration guide provides an audit-grade, production-ready reference for organizing GitHub Actions workflows, Copilot custom instructions, and reusable custom actions in any repository, ensuring maximum compatibility, automation, and maintainability.

---

## 1. Directory Layout

```
.github/
  workflows/
    build.yml
    test.yml
    mobile-devops.yml
    # All workflow YAMLs (automation triggers) go here.
  actions/
    my-composite-action/
      action.yml
      entrypoint.sh
      # Source code for custom (composite/JS/Docker) actions.
    another-action/
      action.yml
  copilot_instructions.md
  scripts/
    build_android.sh
    lint.sh
    # Reusable shell/Python scripts referenced by workflows or actions.
  ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
    bug_report.md
    feature_request.md
  PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```

---

### Explanation & Rationale

- **.github/workflows/**  
  Contains all workflow YAMLs for automation. Only YAMLs here are detected and run by GitHub Actions.  
  [Reference: Workflow syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

- **.github/actions/**  
  For source code of custom actions. Reference these from workflows, never place workflows here.  
  [Reference: Creating actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)

- **.github/copilot_instructions.md**  
  Central Copilot configuration for code, refactor, and workflow standards.  
  [Reference: Copilot org instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-organization-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot)

- **.github/scripts/**  
  All scripts (shell/Python) used in workflows/actions.

- **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**, **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md**  
  Templates for standardizing issues/PRs.  
  [Reference: Issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)

## 2. What NOT to Do

| Directory                          | Acceptable Contents        | Never Put Here                |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| .github/workflows/                  | Workflow YAMLs            | action.yml, scripts, Dockerfiles |
| .github/actions/                    | action.yml, scripts, Dockerfiles | Workflow YAMLs                |
| .github/                            | copilot_instructions.md, templates | Workflow YAMLs                |

**Never place workflow YAMLs in .github/actions/ or any subdirectory other than .github/workflows/**  
**Never place custom action code in .github/workflows/**

---

## 3. Folder Audit Checklist

- [ ] All workflow YAMLs are in .github/workflows/
- [ ] All custom actions are in .github/actions/[action-name]/ with action.yml present
- [ ] All scripts referenced by actions or workflows are in .github/scripts/
- [ ] Copilot instructions are at .github/copilot_instructions.md
- [ ] No workflow YAMLs in .github/actions/ or .github/actions/workflows/
- [ ] Templates in correct .github/ subfolders

## üì± Download Production APK

**üîß BUILD STATUS: Network Access Required**

The WebLabs-MobIDE Docker Ubuntu environment is fully implemented and ready to build. However, APK generation currently requires network access to download Android build dependencies.

### üöÄ **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Docker Ubuntu 24.04 Environment**: Complete implementation
- ‚úÖ **Code-Server Integration**: Web IDE ready
- ‚úÖ **Android App Architecture**: All Kotlin source files ready
- ‚úÖ **Build Configuration**: Android Gradle Plugin 8.2.0 + Kotlin 1.9.22
- ‚è≥ **Network Access**: Requires domains to be added to allowlist

### üåê **Required Domains for APK Build:**
The following domains need to be added to the repository allowlist for successful APK builds:
- `dl.google.com` (Android SDK/tools)
- `maven.google.com` (Android dependencies)
- `repo1.maven.org` (Maven Central)
- `services.gradle.org` (Gradle)

### üì¶ **How to Get APK Once Network Access is Resolved:**

[![Build APK via GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/badge/üîß_Build_APK_-_GitHub_Actions-2EA043?style=for-the-badge&logo=github-actions&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/spiralgang/WebLabs-MobIDE/actions)

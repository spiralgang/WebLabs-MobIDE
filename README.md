# üöÄ WebLabs-MobIDE - Docker Ubuntu Environment

**Your Virtual Linux Development Environment on Android**

A complete Docker-based Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 development environment that runs on Android devices, providing professional development tools, Code-Server web IDE, and AI-powered assistance.

## üì± Download Production APK

**üîß BUILD STATUS: Network Access Required**

The WebLabs-MobIDE Docker Ubuntu environment is fully implemented and ready to build. However, APK generation currently requires network access to download Android build dependencies.

### üöÄ **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Docker Ubuntu 24.04 Environment**: Complete implementation
- ‚úÖ **Code-Server Integration**: Web IDE ready
- ‚úÖ **Android App Architecture**: All Kotlin source files ready
- ‚è≥ **Network Access**: Requires domains to be added to allowlist

### üåê **Required Domains for APK Build:**
The Actions runner must be able to reach every dependency host so the release workflow can complete. See the [GitHub Actions network allowlist guide](docs/operations/actions-network-allowlist.md) for step-by-step configuration, including API automation options. At a minimum, permit outbound connections to:
- `dl.google.com` (Android SDK/tools)
- `maven.google.com` (Android dependencies)
- `repo1.maven.org` (Maven Central)
- `services.gradle.org` (Gradle tooling used only during the CI build)
- `github.com` / `objects.githubusercontent.com` (source checkout and release uploads)
- `actions.githubusercontent.com` (token exchange for GitHub Actions marketplace steps)
- `storage.googleapis.com` (Android build tool mirrors)

### üì¶ **How to Get APK Once Network Access is Resolved:**

[![Build APK via GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/badge/üîß_Build_APK_-_GitHub_Actions-2EA043?style=for-the-badge&logo=github-actions&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/spiralgang/WebLabs-MobIDE/actions)

[![Download Latest Release APK](https://img.shields.io/badge/üì±_Download_APK_-_After_Build-FF6B35?style=for-the-badge&logo=android&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/spiralgang/WebLabs-MobIDE/releases)

**Once network access is configured:**
1. GitHub Actions will automatically build APK on push
2. APK will be available in GitHub Releases
3. Direct download links will be active

## üì¶ Releases

Review comprehensive release notes and download links for the production Android package in the [WebLabs-MobIDE Linux Environment v1.0.0 release document](docs/releases/weblabs-mobide-linux-env.md).

- **Direct APK download:** https://github.com/WebLabs-MobIDE/WebLabs-MobIDE/releases/download/v1.0.0/WebLabs-MobIDE-LinuxEnv.apk
- **Release overview:** https://github.com/WebLabs-MobIDE/WebLabs-MobIDE/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- **Automated release workflow:** [.github/workflows/production-release-apk.yml](.github/workflows/production-release-apk.yml)

Attach the signed APK to the GitHub release using the filename `WebLabs-MobIDE-LinuxEnv.apk` to keep the direct link active and ensure users always have access to the latest build with every documented feature enabled. The production workflow above signs and publishes the APK automatically whenever a semantic version tag (for example `v1.0.1`) is pushed. The uploaded artifact contains only the runtime required to launch WebLabs-MobIDE‚Äîno Gradle wrapper, caches, or auxiliary build tooling are bundled inside the release package.

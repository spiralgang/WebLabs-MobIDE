## Usage

When the Docker container is running, this workspace is mounted to `/home/developer/workspace` inside the container.

### Access Points
- **Web IDE**: http://localhost:8080 (Code-Server)
- **AI Dashboard**: http://localhost:8081 (AI model management)
- **Jupyter Lab**: http://localhost:8888 (Data science interface)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Access web IDE
open http://localhost:8080

# Create new AGI project
cd workspace/projects
cp -r examples/agi-agent my-agi-project
cd my-agi-project
# Edit project.json and implement your AGI system
```

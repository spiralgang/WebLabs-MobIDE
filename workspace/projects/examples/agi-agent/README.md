# Initialize AGI agent
agent = AGIAgent(
    config_file="project.json",
    quantum_features=True,
    agentic_mode="autonomous"
)

# Start agent operation
agent.run()
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Modular Design**: Keep components loosely coupled
2. **Quantum Principles**: Implement quantum-inspired algorithms
